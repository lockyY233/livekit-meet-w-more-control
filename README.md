# LiveKit Meet With More Control

<p>
  This is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/livekit-examples/livekit-meet">LiveKit Meet</a> with more control over the meeting room while also keeping it as light weight as possible for it to be able to run on a 1-2GB ram server.

- **Easy to deploy** - Just run the docker container
- **Customizable** - Change the theme, colors, and more
- **Secure** - Uses LiveKit's secure token system
- **Open Source** - MIT License

# Deployment
